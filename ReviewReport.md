I started this project with intention of using semantic segmentation on still images so it can then be applied to video with intent to use it for autonomous driving. This was a very abitious thought and remains but the expected results for the duration of this course changes to a great extent as I realized the concepts and methodologies that went beind just image processing not to mention performing semantic segmentation to classify objects.

It was fun xploreing a computer science concept which I had never worked with. Throughout this course I learned many new methodologies. I started from a very complex problem then ass I did more reaserch and learned more, the further back I went. Extremely close to prototype week I had reached a very basic starting point and played with image thresholding. With few weeks remaining I then had stepped into and explore Watershed algorithm and SLIC algorithm as the results obtained from thresholding was not ideal. While reading and learning about these algorithms I learned that possibly implementing SLIC algorithm with concepts learned from watershed algorithm and using them to classify objects may work to achieve a simple image segmentation to classify objects without creating and training models. In the near future I plan to attempt to combining SLIC and Watershed algorithm then dip my feet into deep learning and neural network to train models.

Overall, I think I have reached a good understanding on image processing to continue advancing towards ultimately reaching my original goal.
